Weekends were filled with visiting friends in the indigenous Malaysian longhouses and enjoying a cold fresh coconut on a beach in Thailand. My father brought us around the world with his business in consulting for International Aid Agencies and my mother, who has worked in the Travel Industry since the 80s planned every step of our trips (business or leisure - usually a combination of both!). Therefore, I was truly born into the travel industry and learned much of what I know off the dinner table. I was taken on my first hotel inspection in a pram at the age of 4 months at what is now Bali's Amandari and travelled to the African bush twice by the age of 3. The desire to travel and truly immerse myself in different cultures comes naturally to me.",https://media.virtuoso.com/m/Images/Profiles/Staff/w200/C_14871736_1202.webp

There’s also no better feeling than when clients thank you for helping to create amazing memories for them.” Kelly cut her travel teeth travelling alone on her big OE in Europe, which left a lasting impression. “Everyone should travel alone at least once. I met so many people, and did and saw exactly what I wanted without compromise.” Now that Kelly has a family, she can appreciate single, independent travel even more, and it’s also given her insight into what makes a great family holiday, that will please everyone. “I love creating exciting and relaxing holidays for families where both parents and children can reconnect and create amazing memories together.” For this, Thailand is somewhere that often ticks all the boxes – food, culture, weather, luxury spa experiences and amazing resorts. In fact, she rates her most relaxing holiday ever at Six Senses Koh Samui “in the most beautiful ocean-view pool villa”, with an outdoor bathroom and private butler. (Sounds tough…) Kelly’s clients rate her for her patience and commitment to crossing every t and dotting every i, to make sure their trip goes smoothly. She advises, “Pack lightly, call your bank, let them know you are heading overseas and always have the essentials in your hand luggage in case your suitcase goes amiss!” Something Kelly particularly looks forward to every year is when a couple of her regular clients plan their annual getaway. “I have a really lovely couple who take turns at choosing the destination, and whole itinerary.
